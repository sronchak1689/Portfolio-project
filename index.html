                        <p>
                            I attending college from 2008 to 2012. After attending college I was unprepared for 
                            the field I had completed a degree in so I was unable to get a position as a Graphic Designer.
                            While I was helping my wife get her PHd<br/>
                             I worked in a variety of fields and in doing so I believe I have been able
                             to aquire a varity of skills the help me not only in my position but also to the company as a whole. 
                             I have worked as a retail employee at multiple stores. I have learned to put my customer's needs first
                             and how to best solve any current issues and how to prevent future issues. I have also worked in a distribution
                             center for a well known phone case company. I have learned that even when not working directly with a customer that
                             there are multiple ways to make a customer feel like they are the most important. I learned to make sure every action I 
                             took would make should that all orders were placed correctly and accurately to prevent any order issues. I have learned to be
                             a detailed person and achieve a high level of accuracy on all orders. 
                             <br/>
                             <br />

                             I believe I was be a strong asset to any team. I am a hard worker and wont give up till the job is done. 
                             I enjoy working with other people and helping people figure out tough issues. I also believe that a fun
                             work atmostphere is the best atmosphere to work in for productive people. I like to believe that I am someone that 
                             can help breathe that type of attitude and atmosphere in a office.
